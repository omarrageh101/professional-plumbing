## Data Flow

1. **Contact Form Submission**:
   - User fills out contact form on frontend
   - Form data is validated using Zod schema
   - POST request sent to `/api/contact`
   - Server validates and stores contact in database
   - Success/error response returned to client

2. **Contact Retrieval**:
   - Admin can access `/api/contacts` to view all submissions
   - Data retrieved from PostgreSQL database

   - No dynamic content management system
   - Focus on performance and simplicity
